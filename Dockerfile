# Placeholders so build-time env validation (lib/env.ts) passes. middleware.ts
# imports `env` eagerly, and Next.js bundles middleware during `next build` —
# without these, the build throws "Invalid environment variables" before it
# ever produces an image. `next build` also forces NODE_ENV=production
# internally (regardless of what's set here), which is why APP_URL needs a
# placeholder too: lib/env.ts requires it whenever NODE_ENV is "production".
#
# DATABASE_URL, APP_SECRET, and APP_URL are all safe to placeholder here
# because none of them are read at build time in any way that matters — they
# are NOT NEXT_PUBLIC_-prefixed, so Next.js never inlines them into the
# compiled bundle. They're read live from process.env at container runtime
# instead, so env_file/.env supplies the real values when the container
# starts and one built image works for any domain/database (see
# docker-compose.yml). Do NOT put the real production domain here.
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL is different and must stay a harmless placeholder only
# — Next.js inlines NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars into the compiled bundle (client AND
# server chunks) at `next build` time, so whatever is set here would stay
# frozen in the image forever. Nothing in the app actually reads it anymore;
# it's kept only because lib/env.ts still accepts it for backward
# compatibility with older .env files.
