## How configuration works

- All config comes from environment variables. In development they're loaded from
  a local **`.env`** file; in production, set them in your host / container / secrets
  manager.
- **`.env` is git-ignored** (`.gitignore` has `.env*` with `!.env.example`). Only
  **`.env.example`** is committed. Never commit a real `.env`.
- Config is **validated at boot** by [`lib/env.ts`](./lib/env.ts) using Zod. If a
  required variable is missing or invalid, the app **refuses to start** and prints
  which variable failed. This is intentional — fail fast, not at runtime.
- A conditional rule is enforced: **if Google or Zoom OAuth is configured,
  `ENCRYPT_KEY` becomes required** (it encrypts the stored OAuth tokens).

## Setup — step by step (clone to running app)

> This is the **Manual / Node path** — every step below works with the
> codebase as it exists today. There's also a **Docker Compose** path now
> (`docker-compose.yml` at repo root — see `SELF-HOSTING.md` Part 7), which
> collapses steps 1–11 into `docker compose up -d`. It's build-verified but
> hasn't been run end-to-end in a real Docker environment yet — if you hit
> anything, the Manual path below is the fallback that's been tested live.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **pnpm** — this repo pins `pnpm@11.6.0` via `packageManager` in `package.json`;
  run `corepack enable` once and pnpm will auto-use the right version.
- **PostgreSQL 15 or 16** — a server you can create a database on (local install,
  Docker container, or managed: Supabase/Neon/RDS/DigitalOcean).
- A terminal and, for production, a domain name (needed before Google/Zoom OAuth
  will work, since they require a real callback URL).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> schduled
cd schduled
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```
Installs the app, the CLI scripts (`tsx`, `drizzle-kit`), and dev tooling.

### 3. Provision a PostgreSQL database

Use any Postgres 15/16 instance. Example — creating one by hand:
```sql
CREATE USER schduled WITH PASSWORD 'strongpass';
CREATE DATABASE schduled OWNER schduled;
```
**Or**, for local development only, skip this step and use the bundled embedded
Postgres instead: `pnpm db:local` (starts a throwaway Postgres 18 process — not
for production; see `SELF-HOSTING.md` Part 4 §D).

### 4. Create your `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
This copies the template. Every variable below is documented in this file —
open `.env` in an editor and fill it in as you go through the next steps.

### 5. Generate the required secrets

```bash
# APP_SECRET — signs Better Auth sessions, needs 32+ chars
openssl rand -hex 32

# ENCRYPT_KEY — AES-256 key for OAuth tokens, needs exactly 64 hex chars
# (only required if you'll enable Google or Zoom — see step 8)
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Paste the outputs into `APP_SECRET` and `ENCRYPT_KEY` in `.env`.

### 6. Fill in the minimum required variables

Open `.env` and set:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://schduled:strongpass@localhost:5432/schduled
APP_SECRET=<output from step 5>
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000        # or your real https:// domain in production
```
These three are the only variables the app **requires to boot** — see the
next step for why you'll almost certainly want a couple more
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED`, `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP`) too.

### 7. Set up your first login (self-hosting essential)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED=true
ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
```
Email + password is the **primary** login method and is **on by default**, so
the very first sign-in always works on a fresh box with no SMTP or Google. You
only need to touch `NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED` if you want to *disable*
password login (`=false`) for a magic-link/Google-only deployment. Magic link
and Google are the optional secondary methods.

`ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false` closes public sign-up — recommended **from the start**,
not "turn it on, then off later": `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` is exempt from the
gate and can always sign up regardless, so there's no window where a stranger
could register. This was verified directly: with this exact config, a sign-up
attempt from a random email was rejected (`HTTP 400`, no database row
created) while the `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` account signed up and was
auto-promoted to admin. See §3 below for details.

### 8. (Optional) configure email, Google, Zoom, geocoding, storage

Skip this step entirely for a quick local trial — the app runs fine without
any of it (emails log to the console, Google/Zoom buttons stay hidden, storage
defaults to local disk). Add these later, whenever you need them:
- **Email (§2)** — set `SMTP_*` + `EMAIL_FROM` for real email delivery.
- **Google (§4)** — set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` + `ENCRYPT_KEY` for Google sign-in, Calendar sync, and Meet links.
- **Zoom (§5)** — set `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` + `ENCRYPT_KEY` for auto-generated Zoom links.
- **Geocoder (§6)** — optional; free Photon works with zero config.
- **Storage (§7)** — optional; defaults to local disk. `S3`/R2/MinIO is fully wired up now — set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` + the `S3_*` vars.

### 9. Run the database migrations

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```
Creates every table Schduled needs (users, event types, bookings, availability,
audit logs, etc.) — currently 14 migrations, including the `account.password`
column that email+password login (step 7) depends on.

### 10. Build the app (production only — skip for local dev)

```bash
pnpm build
```
For local development, skip this and use `pnpm dev` instead (step 11 covers both).

### 11. Start the app — two processes

Schduled runs as **two separate processes**: the web server and a background
worker (sends emails, reminders, syncs calendars). Both must be running.

**Local development** (single command, runs both together):
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Production** (run each independently, e.g. under systemd/pm2 — see
`SELF-HOSTING.md` Part 7 for example systemd units):
```bash
pnpm start &          # web server on :3000
pnpm worker:start &   # background worker
```

### 12. Create your admin account

Open `APP_URL` in a browser and sign up using the email you set as
`INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` in step 7 (via the password form, since that's enabled).
That account is automatically promoted to admin — no CLI step needed.

**Alternative:** if you skipped step 7 (or want to promote a *different* or
*second* user), sign up any way that's configured, then run:
```bash
pnpm make:admin you@example.com
```

### 13. Verify

- [ ] App loads at `APP_URL`
- [ ] You're signed in and, as the admin, can see the admin-only tabs under `/settings` (Users, Audit, Jobs, Platform)
- [ ] The background worker is running (check its terminal/logs — a test
      booking should trigger a confirmation email, even if it's just logged to
      the console)
- [ ] If configured, Google/Zoom connect successfully from Settings → Integrations

## Minimum required to boot

Only **three** variables are strictly required for the app to start:

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://schduled:pass@localhost:5432/schduled` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `APP_SECRET` | *(32+ random chars)* | Better Auth session signing secret |
| `APP_URL` | `https://schedule.example.com` | Public base URL, **no trailing slash** |

Everything else is optional and unlocks specific features (email, Google, Zoom,
richer geocoding, S3 storage).

> **Login works out of the box:** email + password is the primary method and is
> on by default, so the 3 vars above are enough to both *boot* and *log in* on a
> fresh box — no SMTP or Google needed. See §3 below.

## Full reference by category

Legend: **Req** = Required · **Opt** = Optional · **Cond** = Conditionally required

### 1. Core / App

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | How to get / alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Req** | — | Postgres connection for Drizzle ORM **and** pg-boss job queue | Your Postgres instance. Alternatives: managed (Supabase, Neon, RDS, DO), self-hosted Postgres 15/16, or bundled compose `postgres` service. `postgres://` is auto-normalized to `postgresql://`. Docs: [PostgreSQL connection strings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING). |
| `APP_SECRET` | **Req** | — | Signs Better Auth sessions (needs 32+ chars) | `openssl rand -hex 32`. Keep stable — rotating it logs everyone out. |
| `APP_URL` | **Req** | localhost:3000 in dev | Base URL for OAuth callbacks, email links, session baseURL. No trailing slash. Also determines the auth cookie's `secure` flag (checked via `.startsWith("https://")`) — **use the real public `https://` URL in production**, not `http://localhost`. Deliberately **not** prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — Next.js inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars into the compiled bundle at build time, so a value baked in at image-build time would stay frozen forever; `APP_URL` is read live at runtime instead, so the same built image/deploy works across environments. | Your public URL. Must match OAuth redirect URIs exactly. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Deprecated | — | `APP_URL` above takes priority everywhere. This one is only read as a last-resort fallback (`lib/get-app-url.ts`) if `APP_URL` is unset — don't rely on it. Already removed from `.env.example`. | — |
| `NODE_ENV` | Opt | `development` | `development` \| `test` \| `production`. Affects trusted origins & logging. | Set `production` when deployed. |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | Opt | `20` | Postgres connection pool size per web replica (`lib/db.ts`). | Raise for high traffic; do the math first — `replicas × DB_POOL_MAX` must stay under your database's `max_connections`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANDING_ENABLED` | Opt | `true` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** `false` redirects `/` to `/login` (307, confirmed via `curl`) for internal/team deployments that don't want a public marketing page. Legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`) and booking pages stay public either way (also confirmed live). | Set `false` for internal deployments; leave `true` (default) if you want the marketing landing shown, same as the hosted product. |
| `DEV_TUNNEL_ORIGIN` | Opt | — | **Development only** — allows a tunneling origin (e.g. an ngrok subdomain) to reach `next dev`, for testing OAuth callbacks that need a public URL. Has no effect in production. Not part of `.env.example` on purpose — it's personal to whoever's tunnel it is, not something a template should hardcode. | Set to your own tunnel's hostname if you use one; otherwise leave unset. |
| `GIT_SHA` | Opt | `unknown` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** Surfaced at `/api/version` alongside the `package.json` name/version. Not a normal `.env` variable — it's a **Docker build-arg** (`.git` is excluded from the build context), so it's set at image-build time, not runtime. See `docs/self-hosting/docker.md`. | `docker build --build-arg GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) ...` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Opt | `info` | Log verbosity for the `pino` logger (`lib/logger.ts`). Valid values: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `silent`. | Set directly — no external service. Lower it (e.g. `debug`) for local troubleshooting, raise it (`warn`) to cut noise in production. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` | Opt | `schduled` / `change-me` / `schduled` | Only read by the bundled-Postgres compose files (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.build.yml`) to create that container's initial user/db — **not read by the app itself**. Ignored by the manual/Node path and by `docker-compose.external-db.yml`. | Set your own values; keep them in sync with `DATABASE_URL` above. |

### 2. Email / SMTP

If unset, emails are **logged to the console** instead of sent (fine for dev).
Set these for real delivery (booking confirmations, reminders, magic links).

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | How to get / alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Cond | — | SMTP server hostname | Any SMTP provider (below) or self-hosted Postfix. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Opt | `587` | SMTP port | `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (SSL). |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Opt | `false` | `true` for SSL/465, else STARTTLS | Set `true` only with port 465. |
| `SMTP_USER` | Cond | — | SMTP username | From your provider. |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Cond | — | SMTP password / API token | From your provider. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Opt | — | From header, e.g. `"Schduled <no-reply@example.com>"` | Use a domain you've verified (SPF/DKIM). |
| `EMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Opt | — | Bearer token to validate inbound email-provider webhooks (bounces/opens) | From your provider's webhook config. |

**Email provider options (all SMTP-compatible):**

| Provider | Type | Notes | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted Postfix / Maddy / Mailcow** | Self-hosted | Fully in your control; you manage deliverability (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, IP reputation). | [Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/documentation.html) |
| **Amazon SES** | Cloud, cheap | Great price at scale; SMTP creds from SES console. | [SES SMTP docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-smtp.html) |
| **Resend** | Cloud, dev-friendly | SMTP + API; simple domain setup. | [Resend SMTP docs](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-smtp) |
| **Postmark** | Cloud | Excellent transactional deliverability. | [Postmark SMTP docs](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1002-what-are-the-postmark-smtp-and-api-details) |
| **Mailgun** | Cloud | Widely used SMTP. | [Mailgun SMTP docs](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/user-manual/sending-messages/#sending-via-smtp) |
| **SendGrid** | Cloud | Widely used SMTP. | [SendGrid SMTP docs](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp) |
| **Brevo** | Cloud | Widely used SMTP. | [Brevo SMTP docs](https://developers.brevo.com/docs/send-a-transactional-email#smtp) |
| **Mailtrap** | Testing only | Sandbox that captures mail — do **not** use in production. | [Mailtrap docs](https://mailtrap.io/docs/) |

**Troubleshooting:** wrong `SMTP_SECURE`/port pairing is the most common
connection failure (`465` needs `SMTP_SECURE=true`, `587` needs `false`).
Mail delivered but landing in spam, or rejected outright, almost always
means the sending domain isn't verified with SPF/DKIM records at the
provider — see the provider's docs above for their exact domain-verification
steps.

### 3. Encryption, admin bootstrap & password login

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | How to get / alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ENCRYPT_KEY` | **Cond** | — | AES-256-GCM key encrypting Google/Zoom OAuth tokens at rest. **Required when Google or Zoom OAuth is set.** 64 hex chars. | `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Back this up** — losing it makes stored tokens unrecoverable (users must reconnect). |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Opt | — | **✅ Implemented.** The moment a user with this email signs up (via password, magic link, or Google), they're auto-promoted to admin. Checked once, at account creation only — demoting them later via the admin panel is not overridden by a later sign-in. | Set it before the operator's first sign-up. Alternative: leave blank and run `pnpm make:admin you@example.com` manually after signup (works for any user, any time — e.g. to add a *second* admin). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED` | Opt | `true` | **✅ Implemented.** Email + password is the **primary** login method (min. 8-char password), shown first on both the user and admin login pages; magic link and Google are secondary. **On by default** — works on a fresh box with no SMTP or Google. Set `false` only for a magic-link/Google-only deployment. See `SELF-HOSTING.md` Part 4 §E. | Leave at the default (`true`) unless you specifically want to *disable* password login. |
| `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP` | Opt | `true` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** Gates *all* new-account creation (password sign-up, magic link first-use, Google first-login — they all funnel through the same `databaseHooks.user.create.before` hook). The `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` account is always exempt, so it's safe to close signup from the very start. Tested against a running instance: a random email was rejected (`HTTP 400 FAILED_TO_CREATE_USER`, no DB row written) while the admin email succeeded and was promoted. | **Recommended: set `false` together with `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, from day one** — not "open then close." Only set `true` if you deliberately want open public registration. |

> ✅ **Login works out of the box.** Email + password is on by default, so a
> fresh deploy with only the 3 "minimum to boot" vars — no SMTP, no Google — can
> still sign in. Pair `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false` with `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` so that
> account can bootstrap while public registration stays closed.
>
> Note: password auth uses the `account.password` column added in migration
> `db/migrations/0013_stale_flatman.sql` — run `pnpm db:migrate` (or let the
> Docker entrypoint do it) so it exists.

### 4. Google OAuth (Sign-in + Calendar + Meet)

Optional. Enables "Continue with Google", Google Calendar sync, and Google Meet
links. **Requires `ENCRYPT_KEY`** when set.

| Variable | Req? | Purpose | How to get |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Opt | OAuth client ID | Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth client (Web). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Opt | OAuth client secret | Same screen. |

**Setup steps:**
1. Google Cloud Console → create/select a project.
2. Enable **Google Calendar API**.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen (scopes: `calendar`, `calendar.events`).
4. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Web** client.
5. Add authorized redirect URI:
   `${APP_URL}/api/integrations/google/callback`
   (and the Better Auth sign-in callback if using Google login).
6. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `ENCRYPT_KEY`.

> **Google Meet** links are created through the Google Calendar API — no separate
> credential; connecting Google Calendar enables Meet.

**Official docs:** [Google Calendar API overview](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview) ·
[OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Apps](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server)

**Troubleshooting:** the #1 cause of a failed connection is a redirect URI
that doesn't match exactly (protocol, host, and trailing slash all count).
If only the developer's own Google account can connect while others get
blocked, the OAuth consent screen is still in "Testing" mode — publish it
(or add testers) in the Cloud Console.

### 5. Zoom OAuth (video links)

Optional. Auto-creates Zoom meetings for bookings. **Requires `ENCRYPT_KEY`.**

| Variable | Req? | Purpose | How to get |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID` | Opt | Zoom OAuth client ID | marketplace.zoom.us → Develop → Build App → **OAuth** (or General app). |
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET` | Opt | Zoom OAuth client secret | Same app. |

**Setup steps:**
1. marketplace.zoom.us → **Develop → Build App → OAuth**.
2. Scope: `meeting:write:meeting`.
3. Redirect URL: `${APP_URL}/api/integrations/zoom/callback`.
4. Set `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPT_KEY`.

> Publishing a Zoom app publicly requires Zoom's review (can take weeks). For a
> single self-hosted instance, an unpublished/internal app works for your own account.

**Official docs:** [Zoom OAuth apps](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth/)

**Troubleshooting:** same redirect-URI-mismatch failure mode as Google. An
"invalid scope" error means `meeting:write:meeting` wasn't added (or wasn't
saved) on the app's Scopes tab. A token that stops working after ~15 minutes
just needs Schduled to refresh it automatically — if it doesn't, reconnect
the integration from Settings → Integrations.

### 6. Geocoder (in-person address autocomplete)

Optional. Powers the address field on in-person event types. **Defaults to free,
keyless Photon (OpenStreetMap)** — you don't need to set anything.

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GEOCODER_PROVIDER` | Opt | auto | Pin provider: `photon` \| `google` \| `mapbox` | Auto-detect order: Mapbox → Google → Photon. |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Opt | — | Google Places key (richer results) | Google Cloud Console → Places API. Paid. Docs: [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview). |
| `MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Opt | — | Mapbox geocoding token | mapbox.com account. Paid tier above free quota. Docs: [Mapbox Geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/). |

> Self-hosted alternative: run your own **Photon**/**Nominatim** instance for
> full control (no external calls). Default Photon is fine for most. Docs:
> [Photon](https://github.com/komoot/photon), [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/).

### 7. File storage

Default is `local` (writes to `./uploads`) — no credentials. Switch to `s3`
or `r2` for durable / multi-instance storage. Uploads are always served
through `/api/files/[...key]`, never a direct/public cloud URL — so no
bucket public-access setup is required for any driver.

All of this can also be configured from Settings → Services instead of (or
on top of) the vars below — a value saved there wins and applies live with
no restart. See [`docs/self-hosting/integrations.md`](./docs/self-hosting/integrations.md#integration-settings-db-configuration).

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STORAGE_DRIVER` | Opt | `local` | `local`, `s3`, or `r2` | `local` for single node; `s3`/`r2` for durability/scale. |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | Opt | — | S3-compatible endpoint | Only for non-AWS endpoints (MinIO, DO Spaces, Backblaze B2, ...); omit for real AWS S3. |
| `S3_REGION` | Cond | — | AWS region | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` and not using `S3_ENDPOINT`. |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Cond | — | Bucket name | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3`. |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Opt | — | Access key | Omit to use the standard AWS credential chain (IAM role, shared profile). |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Opt | — | Secret key | See above. |
| `R2_BUCKET` | Cond | — | R2 bucket name | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=r2`. |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cond | — | Cloudflare account ID | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=r2`. |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Cond | — | R2 access key | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=r2`. |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Cond | — | R2 secret key | Required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=r2`. |
| `STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Opt | — | CDN/public domain bound to the bucket | Not required — reads always go through `/api/files/[...key]`. Only matters if you also want to point external tooling at the bucket yourself. |

**s3 driver also covers:** AWS S3, MinIO (self-hosted), DigitalOcean Spaces,
Backblaze B2, and any other S3-compatible endpoint (via `S3_ENDPOINT`).
**r2 driver** is a dedicated Cloudflare R2 integration.

**Official docs:** [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) ·
[Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) ·
[MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html)

**Troubleshooting:** a wrong `S3_REGION` or a bucket name that doesn't exist
yet won't fail at boot (only `S3_BUCKET`/`R2_BUCKET`+`R2_ACCOUNT_ID` are
boot-validated — see the note below) — you'll see it as an upload failing at
request time instead. Create the bucket in the provider's console first, and
double-check the access key has read/write/delete permission on it.

> **What's actually boot-validated:** `lib/env.ts`'s Zod schema only cross-checks
> `S3_BUCKET` (when `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3`) and `R2_BUCKET`+`R2_ACCOUNT_ID` (when
> `STORAGE_DRIVER=r2`) — the app refuses to start if those are missing. The
> other "Cond" fields above (`S3_REGION`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
> `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) aren't cross-validated at boot; get
> them wrong and you'll see the failure at upload time instead. The same is
> true of the SMTP variables in §2 — none of them are boot-validated together.

> ✅ **Implemented**, via [files-sdk](https://files-sdk.dev), in
> [`lib/storage.ts`](./lib/storage.ts) — set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` or `r2` and
> the matching vars above, no code edits needed. Every driver is served
> through [`app/api/files/[...key]/route.ts`](./app/api/files/%5B...key%5D/route.ts),
> so the bucket can stay fully private. Build-verified (`tsc` + `pnpm build`
> clean) and round-trip-tested (upload/download/delete) against a live R2
> bucket.

### 8. Branding & contact emails

| Variable | Req? | Default | Purpose | How to get / alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME` | Opt | `Schduled` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** White-labels the product name: email subjects, iCal `PRODID`, the "Powered by" footer, page titles. Read directly via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME` in `config/platform.ts` (not via the full `lib/env.ts` — that module is now also imported by client components and requires server secrets that would crash a browser bundle). | Set to your own product/company name. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_POWERED_BY` | Opt | `true` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** Shows/hides the "Powered by `<product>`" attribution on public booking pages and the confirmation page. Passed from the parent server-component page down to the client component as a prop. | Set `false` to remove the attribution badge. |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | Opt | — | **✅ Implemented.** Server-only — where the `/contact` page's form submissions are routed. Falls back to `SMTP_USER`, then `hello@schduled.com`, if unset (unchanged fallback chain, just now read via the validated `env` object instead of raw `process.env`). | Set to your support inbox. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Opt | `support@schduled.com` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** Public "Contact us" address shown on the landing page FAQ and the `/contact` page's "General Enquiries" channel. | Set to your public-facing contact address. |
| `PRIVACY_EMAIL` | Opt | `privacy@schduled.com` | **✅ Implemented — verified live.** Shown on `/contact`, `/privacy`, and `/cookies` for data requests. | Set to your privacy/legal contact address. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGO_URL` | Opt | — | Absolute URL to a logo image shown at the top of every email, next to `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_NAME`. Unset keeps the built-in Schduled logo (a self-hoster with a custom product name but no logo gets a text-only header instead). | Set to your own hosted logo image. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_BRAND_COLOR` | Opt | Schduled teal | Accent color (hex) used for buttons/links in emails. | Set to your own brand color, e.g. `#0D9488`. |

### 9. Not-yet-implemented integrations (for reference — do NOT set)

These ecosystems appear in the data model but have **no working client yet**, so
there are currently **no env vars to set** and nothing is required. Listed only so
the reference is complete; they're on the "later, for Calendly parity" list in
SELF-HOSTING.md.

| Would-be integration | Future variables (not active) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft / Outlook / Office 365 calendar | `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Not implemented — only Google works today |
| Microsoft Teams video links | (via Microsoft OAuth above) | Not implemented — only Zoom works today |
| Outbound webhooks | per-user, configured in-app (no global env) | Not implemented |
| Public REST API | API keys stored in DB (no global env) | Not implemented |

> **Today's working integrations are Google (Calendar + Meet) and Zoom only.**
> Don't set Microsoft/Teams variables — they do nothing yet.

## Example `.env` files

### Minimal (dev, magic-link only, emails to console)

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://schduled:pass@localhost:5432/schduled
APP_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Fine for local development — you have a terminal open, so a console-logged
magic link is a non-issue. **Not recommended for a real deployment** — see the
self-hosted example below.

### Self-hosted first boot (recommended starting point)

This example assumes Docker Compose's bundled Postgres (`docker-compose.yml`).
Already have your own database (managed service or self-run)? Use
`docker-compose.external-db.yml` instead, drop `POSTGRES_USER`/
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`POSTGRES_DB` (they don't apply), and point `DATABASE_URL`
at your own host — see `docs/self-hosting/installation.md`, Path A2.

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://schduled:strongpass@postgres:5432/schduled
POSTGRES_USER=schduled
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strongpass
POSTGRES_DB=schduled
APP_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
APP_URL=https://schedule.example.com

# Guarantees the first login works even before SMTP/Google are configured
NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED=true

# Closes public sign-up from the start — INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL is exempt, so
# there's no "open window" between deploy and closing it
ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false

# Auto-promotes this email to admin the moment it signs up
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

Add SMTP/Google/Zoom/storage vars below once you're ready — none of them are
required to get a working, logged-in instance running.

> ✅ **The open-signup gap has been fixed and verified live.**
> `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false` blocks new-account creation for anyone except the
> `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` account (tested: a random email got `HTTP 400`, no
> database row written; the admin email succeeded and was promoted). It's
> safe to include `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false` from your very first deploy — no
> need to "open then close" it manually.

### Production (SMTP + Google + Zoom + local storage)

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://schduled:strongpass@postgres:5432/schduled
POSTGRES_USER=schduled
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=strongpass
POSTGRES_DB=schduled
APP_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
APP_URL=https://schedule.example.com

# First-run admin + login safety net (see "Self-hosted first boot" above)
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD_AUTH_ENABLED=true
ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false

# Email
SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=<smtp-user>
SMTP_PASS=<smtp-pass>
EMAIL_FROM="Schduled <no-reply@example.com>"

# OAuth token encryption (required because Google/Zoom are set)
ENCRYPT_KEY=<openssl rand -hex 32>

# Google Calendar + Meet
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<id>.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>

# Zoom
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=<id>
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>

# Storage (default local; uploads should be on a persistent volume)
STORAGE_DRIVER=local
```

### Production with Cloudflare R2 storage

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER=r2
R2_BUCKET=schduled-uploads
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=<cloudflare-account-id>
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
```

### Production with S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO, DO Spaces, ...)

```env
STORAGE_DRIVER=s3
S3_BUCKET=schduled-uploads
S3_REGION=auto
# S3_ENDPOINT=https://<endpoint>   # only for non-AWS providers
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key>
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
```

## Known limitations for self-hosters (read before production use)

None of these block a self-hosted deployment, but each is a real gap a
production operator should know about up front rather than discover later.
All are tracked with fixes in `SELF-HOSTING.md` Part 4.

- ~~Open signup while password auth is on~~ — **fixed.** `ALLOW_PUBLIC_SIGNUP=false`
  (recommended default for self-host) closes it; `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` is
  exempt. Verified live — see the "Self-hosted first boot" example above.
- **CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts and styles.** Security headers
  (`next.config.mjs`) ship a pragmatic CSP, not a strict nonce-based one —
  `'unsafe-inline'` is needed for Next.js's hydration bootstrap script and
  Tailwind's inline style attributes. `frame-ancestors 'none'` and
  `object-src 'none'` are still enforced (no embedding, no plugins). A fully
  strict CSP would require nonce-generation middleware, a larger change not
  done in this pass.
- **Rate limiting is per-instance, not shared.** `lib/api/helpers.ts` uses an
  in-process `Map` (confirmed via its own code comment: "Single-instance only").
  Running more than one web replica means each replica enforces its own
  independent limit — the *effective* limit becomes N× what's documented, and
  counters reset on every restart/redeploy. Fine for a single instance; don't
  scale to multiple web replicas without replacing this with a shared
  (DB/Redis-backed) limiter.
- ~~Auth cookies behind a reverse proxy aren't explicitly configured~~ —
  **investigated and this isn't actually an issue.** Better Auth derives the
  cookie's `secure` flag from `APP_URL` itself (checked via
  `.startsWith("https://")`), never from request headers — confirmed by
  reading `better-auth`'s own source. Just make sure `APP_URL` is
  the real public `https://` URL in production.
- ~~DB connection pool is fixed at 20, not env-configurable, no connect-retry~~
  — **fixed.** `DB_POOL_MAX` env var (§1) controls pool size; a bounded
  connect-retry now runs once at server boot via `instrumentation.ts`, smoothing
  over Docker Compose startup ordering.
- **Docker packaging is build-verified, not deploy-verified.** The `Dockerfile`,
  `Dockerfile.worker`, and both compose files were written and every piece they
  depend on was individually confirmed (standalone build output exists at the
  right paths, both compose files parse as valid YAML, `drizzle-kit` is a
  production dependency so the dedicated `migrate` service can find it,
  `middleware.ts`'s eager `lib/env.ts` import is satisfied by the Dockerfile's
  build-time placeholder env vars) — but an actual `docker build` /
  `docker compose up` has not been run, since Docker wasn't available in the
  environment this was built in. Run it once yourself before trusting it in
  production.
- ~~Logs are unstructured~~ — **fixed.** `lib/logger.ts` uses `pino`, emitting
  structured JSON in production (pretty-printed only in an interactive dev
  terminal); level is configurable via the optional `LOG_LEVEL` env var
  (default `info`).
- **No down-migrations.** Drizzle migrations are forward-only. If an upgrade's
  migration causes problems, the recovery path is **restore your pre-upgrade
  database backup and redeploy the previous image/commit** — not an automated
  rollback. Always back up before running `pnpm db:migrate` on an upgrade.
- **`ENCRYPT_KEY` has no rotation tooling.** It's a single static key with no
  versioning. Rotating it today means manually decrypting and re-encrypting
  every stored Google/Zoom token — there's no script for this yet. Treat it
  like a long-lived secret you back up, not one you rotate casually.
- **No CORS policy on API routes.** Fine today (no public/cross-origin API
  surface exists), but relevant if you build anything that calls Schduled's
  API from another origin before an official public API ships.

---

## Security notes

- **Never commit a real `.env`.** Only `.env.example` is tracked.
- **Rotate the secrets** currently in your local `.env` (Google, Zoom, SMTP, S3,
  `APP_SECRET`, `ENCRYPT_KEY`) before making the repo public.
- **Back up `ENCRYPT_KEY`** with your database backups — without it, encrypted
  OAuth tokens can't be decrypted and every user must reconnect calendars/Zoom.
  There is currently no key-rotation tooling (see "Known limitations" above).
- Use a **secrets manager** (Docker secrets, Vault, SSM, Doppler) in production
  rather than a plaintext file where possible.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are **exposed to the browser** — never put secrets in
  a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name.
