# Meetings Dashboard

The Meetings Dashboard is the host's central hub for managing all booked meetings — past, present, and upcoming. Without it, a host has no single place to see what's on their calendar through Schduled, making booking management impossible.

---

## Overview

Every host needs to answer these questions at a glance:
- "Who am I meeting today?"
- "What did that client say in their booking form?"
- "Did that meeting yesterday actually happen?"
- "Show me all meetings I had last month"

The Meetings Dashboard answers all of these. It is the first screen a returning host sees after logging in.

## User Stories

**Host**

- Invitee email address
- Event type name
- Meeting notes content

### Search Behavior

- Highlights matched term in results
- Shows meeting date alongside each result for context
- Empty state: "No meetings found for '[query]'"

---

## Filters

Narrow the meeting list by specific criteria.

### Available Filters

| Filter | Options | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Status | All, Upcoming, Completed, Cancelled, No-Show | *(MVP)* |
| Event Type | All, or select specific event type(s) | *(MVP)* |
| Date Range | Today, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Custom range | *(MVP)* |
| Location | All, Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Phone, In-Person | *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)* |
| Host (teams) | All team members, or specific member | *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)* |

> **Why Location and Host filters are Phase 2:** Solo users at launch have 1–2 location types and no team members to filter by. Adding these filter options at MVP is premature — they add UI weight with zero real-world filtering value for a solo user.

### Filter Behavior
- Filters apply instantly (no submit button)
- Active filters shown as removable chips above the list
- "Clear all filters" resets to default view
- Filter state preserved when navigating away and returning

---

## Sorting

Control the order meetings are displayed.

### Sort Options
- Date (newest first / oldest first) — default *(MVP)*
- Invitee name (A–Z / Z–A) *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)*
- Event type name (A–Z) *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)*
- Duration (shortest / longest) *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)*

> **Why only date sort at launch:** Solo users with 10–50 meetings don't need A–Z sort. They know who they're meeting and find them by date or search. Advanced sort adds UI complexity (sort dropdown, state management) for near-zero MVP-scale value.

---

## Bulk Actions (Teams / Admin) *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)*

For users with multiple team members' meetings visible.

### Bulk Select
- Checkbox on each meeting card
- "Select all" on current page
- Bulk cancel selected meetings
- Bulk export selected meetings to CSV

> **Why Phase 2:** Bulk actions are a teams/admin feature. Solo users at MVP scale (10–50 meetings) don't need to bulk cancel or export — they use the individual detail view. Adds significant UI complexity (selection state, confirmation dialogs, CSV generation) with zero solo-user value.

---

## Dashboard Stats Summary

At the top of the dashboard, a quick-stats bar shows:

| Stat | Description | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Today's meetings | Count of meetings scheduled today | *(MVP)* |
| Upcoming (total) | All future confirmed bookings | *(MVP)* |
| This week | Count of meetings this calendar week | *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)* |
| Cancelled this month | Number of cancellations this calendar month | *(Post-MVP — Phase 2)* |

> **Why two stats are Phase 2:** "Today's count" tells a solo host what they actually need: what's happening right now. "Upcoming total" shows pipeline. "This week" and "Cancelled this month" are useful metrics but add no decision-making value at MVP scale and complicate the stats bar.

---

## Empty States

Clear messaging when there are no meetings.

### No Upcoming Meetings
> "No upcoming meetings. Share your booking link to get started."
> [Copy Booking Link] button

### No Past Meetings
> "You haven't had any meetings yet. Your completed meetings will appear here."

### No Search Results
> "No meetings found for '[query]'. Try a different name or email."

---

## Notifications from Dashboard

The dashboard is also the anchor for in-app notifications.

### Notification Bell *(MVP)*
- Unread count badge on bell icon
- Dropdown shows recent booking events:
  - "New booking: Jane Smith — 30-min call on Thursday 3pm"
  - "Cancelled: John Doe cancelled his meeting"
  - "Rescheduled: Sarah Lee moved her meeting to Friday 2pm"
- Mark all as read
- Click notification → jumps to that meeting's detail view

## Background Jobs

When a host cancels a booking from the dashboard, two jobs are dispatched to clean up scheduled reminders and notify the invitee.

| Job Name | Trigger | What It Does | pg-boss Config |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `BOOKING_CANCEL_REMINDERS` | Host cancels booking from dashboard | Cancels the 24h and 1h reminder jobs for this booking by singletonKey so reminders don't fire for a cancelled meeting | `retryLimit: 3, retryDelay: 10` |
| `EMAIL_SEND` | Host cancels booking from dashboard | Sends cancellation notification email to invitee via email_outbox pattern | `retryLimit: 5, retryDelay: 30` |

**BOOKING_CANCEL_REMINDERS handler:** Registered with `workMonitored()` (not raw `boss.work()`). Receives the `bookingId`, then calls `boss.cancel()` for both `BOOKING_REMINDER_24H` and `BOOKING_REMINDER_1H` using their singletonKeys. See `jobs-queues.md` for the dead-letter queue monitoring pattern.

**Host cancel Server Action flow:** Inside a single DB transaction: update `bookings.status` to `'cancelled'`, insert an `email_outbox` row for the host-cancellation-to-invitee email, and insert an `audit_logs` row with `action: 'booking.cancelled_by_host'`. After the transaction commits: enqueue `BOOKING_CANCEL_REMINDERS` and `EMAIL_SEND` jobs.

---

## Audit Logging

Every host cancel from the dashboard writes an immutable audit record.

| Action | When | Actor | source | Data Logged |
|--------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `booking.cancelled_by_host` | Host clicks Cancel in dashboard | Host user ID | `'web'` | bookingId, invitee email, cancellation reason, original start time |

The `source: 'web'` value indicates this was a Server Action triggered by the authenticated host. See `database-schema.md` for `auditSourceEnum`.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js App Router server components** — the dashboard page fetches all booking data directly on the server at render time using Drizzle queries. No client-side data fetching for the initial page load — the full meeting list renders immediately.
- **Better Auth** — all dashboard routes are protected. The server component reads the current session using `auth.api.getSession()` and redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. Custom Next.js admin pages can access all users' meeting data via the admin role.
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — all dashboard queries (upcoming list, past list, cancelled list, search, filter, stats) run directly against the `bookings` table with joins to `event_types` and `booking_answers`. Pagination, status filtering, and date range filtering are handled at the database level for efficiency. The **Timeline / Activity Log** in the meeting detail view is powered by reading `audit_logs` rows where `targetId = bookingId` — this gives the full history of booking events (created, rescheduled, cancelled) in chronological order.
- **pg-boss** — when a host cancels a meeting from the dashboard, `BOOKING_CANCEL_REMINDERS` is dispatched to cancel any pending reminder jobs for that booking, and `EMAIL_SEND` is dispatched to notify the invitee. Both are enqueued after the DB transaction commits so the booking record is guaranteed to exist.
- **audit_logs** — every host cancellation from the dashboard writes a `booking.cancelled_by_host` record inside the same DB transaction as the status update.
- **UI Kit** (`components/ui/`) — provides the meeting list cards, filter chips, search input, status badges, date grouping layout, and the meeting detail drawer/modal.
